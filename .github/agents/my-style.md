# My Personal Coding Style

Whenever you help me with code, please follow these rules:

## How I Like My Code to Look
- Use descriptive names for variables (not single letters like "x" or "n")
- Add comments explaining what complex code does
- Keep lines short enough to read without scrolling sideways
- Use 2 spaces for indentation (not 4, not tabs)

## How I Like Explanations
- Explain things like I'm new to coding
- Don't use jargon without explaining it
- Give me examples when explaining concepts
- Break complex things into smaller steps

## My Preferences
- I prefer simple code over clever code
- I'd rather have more readable code than shorter code
- Always tell me if there's a better way to do something
